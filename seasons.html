    <h3>SPRING</h3>
    <div class="spring">
      <div class="springBox">
        <p>
          --Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
          <br />
          The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
          <br />
          And ’tis my faith that every flower
          <br />
          Enjoys the air it breathes.
          <br /><br />
          The birds around me hopped and played,
          <br />
          Their thoughts I cannot measure:—
          <br />
          But the least motion which they made
          <br />
          It seemed a thrill of pleasure.--
          <br />
          <br />
